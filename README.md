# keylogger

ofstream

stands for "output file stream".
It is part of <fstream>

ofstream does:
Opening Files
Writing Data
Closing Files

=================

if (!keystrokeFile.is_open())
 checks whether the file `keystrokes.txt` was opened.

Let's break it down:

- `keystrokeFile.is_open()`:
member function of the `ofstream` class,
which returns `true`
if the file associated with the `ofstream` object is currently open,
and `false` otherwise.
It checks whether the file stream has been successfully opened
and is ready for writing.

- `!keystrokeFile.is_open()`:
if the file is not open (`keystrokeFile.is_open()` returns `false`),
this condition evaluates to `true`,
indicating that there was an error opening the file.
